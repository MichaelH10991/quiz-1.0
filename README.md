# quiz-1.0

The new and improved quiz UI.

See the app here: http://language-quiz-1.0.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

I was not happy with the UI for the original quiz game here: https://github.com/MichaelH10991/language-quiz. So I learned some html and css here: https://github.com/MichaelH10991/html-css-pro and I'm re-writing the whole thing with my newly gained knowledge.

It has been a long time coming on my journey as a developer. html and css was one of those things that I didnt really take to. I've since learned that being diciplined is something that sets apart a good developer from a great developer.

Enjoy.
